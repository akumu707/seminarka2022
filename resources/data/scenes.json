Zájemci projdou základním výcvikem a vedoucí tréninku poté usoudí, kdo z účastníků má na to, aby se přidal ke svým starším kolegům a získal nehynoucí slávu jako člen našeho společenství. Přihlášky si vyzvedněte v naší kanceláři a odevzdejte do konce týdne. Výcvik začíná v pondělí v 9 hodin, účastníci jsou povinni hlásit se u velitele kasáren alespoň o hodinu dříve. Strava zaručena."},
